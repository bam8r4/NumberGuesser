NumberGuesser

Just a very simple and not very well written c# cosole program so I can brush up on some skills in Visual Studio with sending things to and from github. 

You will be asked to input a number and the program will check to see if you guessed the correct number. It will prompt you untill you find the correct solution. 
I did not do any kind of type checking or exception handling in this. As noted above it is very basic so if you input a non integer string you will crash the program. Seconly,
it does not handle null.
